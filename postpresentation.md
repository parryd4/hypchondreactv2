+ Not clearing Treatment Info or Form on top while starting a new search. Can handle by adding a new state attribute to track if user is viewing a Form or Treatment. URL didn't change when starting a new search, so explore ways to trigger render and unmount top component.


## Future Features
+ mode than 1 model, with has_many and belongs_to relationships.
+ Body image to select/filter Group of Bodyparts.
